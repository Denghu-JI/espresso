"""Template script file(s)

An example script file that has similar content with what's inside the Jupyter 
notebook in the same folder. This file won't contain as much explanation text as in 
the notebook.

Similar to the library code, this file is optional. You can safely delete it if not
needed.

Feel free to rename the file name into whatever suits your example, but keep in mind
not to end it with "_lib.py".
