"""Template library file(s)

Please put all the library code that will be needed in the notebook in this file.

This file is optional. You can safely delete it if not needed.

The file name should end with "_lib.py", otherwise our bot may fail when generating
scripts for Sphinx Gallery. Furthermore, we recommend the file name to start with your
forward problem name, to align well with the naming of Jupyter notebook.

Feel free to replace the code template below with your own forward code.
