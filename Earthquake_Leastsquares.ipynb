    "# Earthquake location using iterative least squares # \n",
    "This problem focuses on iteratively determining a 3-dimensional earthquake location from travel times recorded at stations in the vincinity. The model consists of a three-dimensional earthquake location $x, y, z$ and the origin time $t_0$. The forward calculation consists of $R=\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$, meaning the problem is non-linear. The inversion is performed using an iterative matrix-based approach. We use a homogeneous crustal Earth model with wave speed, v=5.8 km/s\n",

    "- Model: Earthquake location $(z, y, x)$ and origin time $t_0$\n",
    "- Data: Travel time $t$ to recording stations\n",
    "- Forward: Non-linear; $\\int_R \\frac{1}{v(x)} dl$, with $R=\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$, which becomes $t = \\frac{R}{v}$ with $v(x) = v = const.$ \n",

    "    - eql_basics.noise: Adds normally distributed noise to the travel time recordings (single float; between 0 and 1); the maximum of the distribution is set to eql_basics.noise*maximum(data)\n",
    "- ``model=eql_fcn.init_routine(eql_basics)`` initialises a starting model, if it has not been set previously.\n",
